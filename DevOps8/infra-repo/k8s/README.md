# XOps Microchallenge #8 â€“ ConfigMaps vs Secrets âš¡

This challenge demonstrates how to use **Kubernetes ConfigMaps** for non-sensitive configuration and **Secrets** for sensitive data like credentials.

---

## ConfigMaps
- Store **non-sensitive configuration** such as environment settings, feature flags, or app properties.
- Example:  
  - `APP_MODE=dev`  
  - `FEATURE_X_ENABLED=true`
- Can be injected into pods as:
  - âœ… Environment variables  
  - âœ… Mounted files  

---

## Secrets
- Store **sensitive data** such as credentials, API tokens, certificates.
- Data is **base64-encoded** (not encrypted by default).
- Can be injected into pods as:
  - âœ… Environment variables  
  - âœ… Mounted files  
- Should be encrypted at rest using **KMS** for security.

---

## Best Practices
âœ… Use **ConfigMaps** for non-sensitive app configs  
âœ… Use **Secrets** for passwords, tokens, certificates  
âœ… Never store sensitive data in ConfigMaps  
âœ… Enable **encryption at rest** for Secrets  
âœ… Use **RBAC** to restrict access to Secrets

## âœ… Summary
- **ConfigMaps** â†’ Non-sensitive configs (env vars, feature flags, app settings).  
- **Secrets** â†’ Sensitive data (DB creds, API keys, certificates).  
- Together, they help keep configuration flexible and secure in Kubernetes.
